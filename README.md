# Radiotrack

A web app for tracking airtimes of live radio programs. It's basically a glorified notepad for very specific information.

This is a work in progress. It's a learning project, initially based on the Django tutorial found in the book _Python Crash Course_ by Eric Matthes.

## In Scope
* Radiotrack is a way for me to compile and maintain a simple list of regularly-recurring live radio programs I enjoy and might want to listen to.
* This includes information about when to listen, what radio station they are on (terrestrial or internet).
* Sorting and filtering the list of programs is within scope, but not yet implemented. 
* Making the lists of programs or stations accessible via API is within scope, but not yet implemented.

## Out of scope
* This is not about recording programs to listen later.
* This is not about podcasts, or other forms of media.
* This is not about discovering new content to listen to.
* Interfaces with social media is not part of this project, but may be implemented later as a separate project.

## Maybe later...
* Notifications when a program is about to start.
